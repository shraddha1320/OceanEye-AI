# Problem Statement
Marine plastic pollution is a growing environmental crisis.  
The goal of OceanEye-AI is to detect and classify plastic waste floating on ocean surfaces using aerial or satellite images.  
The system uses Deep Learning (CNN) to automatically identify polluted regions, helping organizations track and clean affected marine zones efficiently.
