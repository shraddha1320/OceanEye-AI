# Problem Statement: OceanEye-AI 

### Overview
The health of our oceans is declining due to pollution, overfishing, and rising temperatures. Monitoring marine conditions manually is slow, expensive, and limited to small regions. There is a need for an intelligent system that can analyze oceanic data efficiently and provide real-time insights for researchers and policymakers.

# Objective
OceanEye-AI aims to develop an *AI-powered ocean observation platform* that:
- Collects and analyzes *satellite & sensor-based marine data*
- Detects patterns of pollution, temperature rise, or coral bleaching
- Predicts environmental changes using *machine learning models*
- Visualizes trends on an *interactive dashboard*

---
# Why It’s Important
Oceans regulate our planet’s climate and support over 80% of life on Earth.  
However, the lack of real-time analytics tools limits our ability to take timely action.  
OceanEye-AI bridges this gap with *AI-driven marine monitoring*, promoting sustainable ocean management.

---
# Key Goals
- Create a centralized data pipeline for ocean monitoring
- Integrate machine learning for anomaly detection
- Offer predictive insights through dashboards and visualizations
- Support global sustainability and SDG-14 (Life Below Water)

---
# Expected Outcome
An intelligent, data-driven platform that helps scientists, environmentalists, and government bodies make *faster and smarter decisions* for ocean conservation.
